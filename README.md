## Intro
You must have node and docker-compose
#### Install 
 ~~~bash
npm install 
 ~~~

#### Running docker-compose 
This will run the api on port **15050**
postgres and redis will also run
This might take a few minutes
 ~~~bash
npm run up 
 ~~~
 
#### Running migrations and seeds
running seeds is optional, if you run 3 sample shirts will be added to database
 ~~~bash
npm run migration && npm run seed 
 ~~~

#### Stopping  docker-compose
This will kill all process, but data will saved
 ~~~bash
npm run down 
 ~~~

#### Debug 
If you use VS Code this will be very helpful our docker runs with nodemon watching /dist folder. You can debug/add breakpoints on a docker cointainer!
 ~~~bash
npm run watch
 ~~~
This command below only run unit test that are on staging, very handy when codding
  ~~~bash
npm run test:unit
 ~~~
 
#### Test 
Finally you can check all test by running:
 ~~~bash
npm run test
 ~~~
